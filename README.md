<div style="text-indent: 2em;">
  I got into backend development intentionally. While surfing the internet, I was always curious about what happens “on the other side” - beyond what’s visible. In this field, you're more of an engineer than a designer, and you’re not subject to personal taste - something I often had to deal with when working as a 3D artist.

<div style="text-indent: 2em;">
  I chose Python because of its simplicity and versatility, the vast number of libraries, wide range of use cases, and strong demand in the job market.

<div style="text-indent: 2em;">
  What really motivates me in this work is discovering and applying new solutions I haven’t seen before. I enjoy turning a clearly defined task into working code.
